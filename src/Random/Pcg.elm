{-| Generate psuedo-random numbers and values, by constructing
[generators](#Generator) for them. There are a bunch of basic generators like
[`bool`](#bool) and [`int`](#int) that you can build up into fancier generators
with functions like [`list`](#list) and [`map`](#map).

You run a `Generator` by calling the [`step`](#step) function, which
also takes a random [`Seed`](#Seed), and passes back a new seed. You should
never use the same seed twice because you will get the same result! If you need
random values over time, you should store the most recent seed in your model. If
you have many separate models, you can give them all [independent
seeds](#independentSeed).

This is an implementation of [PCG](http://www.pcg-random.org/) by M. E. O'Neil,
and is not cryptographically secure.

{-| Generate a random value as specified by a given `Generator`, using a `Seed`
and returning a new one.

In the following example, we are trying to generate numbers between 0 and 100
with the `int 0 100` generator. Each time we call `generate` we need to provide
a seed. This will produce a random number and a *new* seed to use if we want to
run other generators later.

    (x, seed1) = step (int 0 100) seed0
    (y, seed2) = step (int 0 100) seed1
    (z, seed3) = step (int 0 100) seed2
    [x, y, z] -- [85, 0, 38]

Notice that we use different seeds on each line. This is important! If you reuse
the same seed, you get the same results.

    (x, _) = step (int 0 100) seed0
    (y, _) = step (int 0 100) seed0
    (z, _) = step (int 0 100) seed0
    [x,y,z] -- [85, 85, 85]

As you can see, threading seeds through many calls to `step` is tedious and
error-prone. That's why this library includes many functions to build more
complicated generators, allowing you to call `step` only a small number of
times.

Our example is best written as:

    (xs, newSeed) = step (list 3 <| int 0 100) seed0
    xs -- [85, 0, 38]

{-| A `Seed` is the source of randomness in the whole system. It hides the
current state of the random number generator.

Generators, not seeds, are the primary data structure for generating random
values. Generators are much easier to chain and combine than functions that take
and return seeds. Creating and managing seeds should happen "high up" in your
program.
-}

    = -- state and increment
      Seed Int64 Int64


{-| Take two integers to fully initialize the 64-bit state of the random
number generator. Only the least significant 32 bits of each integer matter, and
those bits should be as random as possible. The first argument is the high bits,
but if you're pulling from a random data source, it shouldn't matter.

You can generate and copy random integers to create a reproducible psuedo-random
generator.

    $ node
    > Math.floor(Math.random()*0xFFFFFFFF)
    227852860
    > Math.floor(Math.random()*0xFFFFFFFF)
    1498709020

    -- Elm
    seed0 : Seed
    seed0 = initialSeed2 227852860 1498709020

Alternatively, you can generate the random integers on page load and pass them
through a port. The program will be different every time.

    -- Elm
    port randomSeed : (Int, Int)

    seed0 : Seed
    seed0 = (uncurry initialSeed2) randomSeed

    -- JS
    Elm.fullscreen(Elm.ModuleName,
      {randomSeed: [Math.floor(Math.random()*0xFFFFFFFF),
                    Math.floor(Math.random()*0xFFFFFFFF)] })

Either way, you should initialize a random seed only once. After that, whenever
you use a seed, you'll get another one back.

{-| A generator that produces a seed that is independent of any other seed in
the program. These seeds will generate their own unqiue sequences of random
values. They are useful when you need an unknown amount of randomness *later*

Let's say you write a component that uses some randomness to initialize itself
and then never needs randomness again. You can easily write a `Generator
Component` by mapping over the generators it needs. But if component requires
randomness after initialization, it should keep its own independent seed, which
it can get by mapping over *this* generator.

    type alias Component = { seed : Seed }

    genComponent : Generator Component

If you have a lot of components, you can initialize them like so:

    genComponents constructors =
      list (List.length constructors) independentSeed
          |> map (List.map2 (<|) constructors)

purposes. However, it is not proven that there are no pathological cases.

{-| Chain random operations by providing a callback that accepts a
randomly-generated value. The random value can be used to drive more randomness.

The argument order matches `andThen`s from core, but requires the use of `flip`
to match `map` or work with `|>` chains.

This example shows how we can use `andThen` to generate a list of random values
*and* random length. Then we use `map` to apply a stateless function to that
list. Assume we already have `genName : Generator String` defined.

    authors : Generator String
    authors =
      int 1 5 -- number of authors
      |> (flip andThen) (\i -> list i genName)

          [] ->
            "This can't happen"
        )

If you find yourself calling `constant` in every branch of the callback, you can
probably use `map` instead.
